    "description": "\n    <h2>Welcome to the \"Sustainability in the Digital Age\" series</h2>\\n\\n<p>In an era where \"\n    digital technologies are reshaping industries and daily life, the environmental impact of AI systems has \n    become a growing concern. This course explores efficient AI methodologies to address these challenges. From \n    deep learning model compression to low-bit quantization and collaborative inference, we delve into techniques \n    that enhance computational efficiency and reduce energy consumption. In Week 2, we focus on low-bit \n    quantization specifically for large language models (LLMs), showcasing cutting-edge open-source tools and \n    models. Join us to learn how to build sustainable AI systems while pushing the boundaries of innovation. \n    </p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>This course is part of the <strong>Sustainability in the Digital Age</strong> series, \n    a collaborative project between colleagues from Stanford University, SAP and the Hasso Plattner Institute. </p>\\n\n    ",
